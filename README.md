# genotype_frequency
This program finds out the genotypic frequencies of organisms over time based on their comparative reproductive fitness. 
Which means that given two traits, if you know how many average offspring organisms with those different traits have , you can find out what percentage of the population has either trait over time, and graph that.

So if we had two traits in a population of bears, lets say light fur and dark fur, and we know that light haired bears have 1 child on average and make up 75% of the population while dark haired bears have 2 kids on average and make up 25% of the population , then we can write a program that graphs their demographics over time. This is exactly what my program does.
